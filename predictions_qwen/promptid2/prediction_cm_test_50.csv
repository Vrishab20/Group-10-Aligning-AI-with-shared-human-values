0,"AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. 

A few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. 

I want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. 

One day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?

The next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. 

So I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.",False,False,tutor responsibility class absence wait time

0,"AITA for wanting to sleep in? | Some back story, I wake up at 430am every weekday go to work til 830am, come home to my wife and daughter still sleeping and wake them up to start their day and eat breakfast. I then go back to work at 930 until roughly 5/6pm every day. 
I come home, I help out around the house, clean, bathe the kid sometimes I cook. Then I play video games until 9pm followed by a movie with the wife until roughly 11pm.

Weekends are a completely different story, I get woken up at 9 by my wife and I tell her every time that I’d like just one day to sleep in, not until 2pm, but like 10/1030am because I’m tired from waking up and working long hours.
We proceed to get into a pretty heated argument about how when I’m home she expects me to do just as much as she does (which is understandable) but she asked all her friends about me sleeping in and they all tell her to “wake my ass up” “what the fuck parent wants to sleep in?” Etc etc.

0,"AITA for treating my stepfamily like extended family at my wedding? | My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.

I didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. 

I did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.

As far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close. I would think it was weird if one of my step siblings asked me to be a bridesmaid, or if my mom walked one of them down the aisle.

0,"AITA for revealing to a prospective employer of my former employee that he shares pay information with coworkers, possibly costing him a job? | To preface this, I run a small business with fewer than 20 employees. I have a former employee who we will call Adam. He left on good terms, but it came to my attention months after his departure that either during or after his employment term, he had told coworkers his payrate, asked for and acquired theirs, and openly shared this set of information with multiple people at the company. This has caused a number of ongoing problems, productivity and jealousy related, amongst staff.

I understand under federal law it is illegal to terminate someone for discussing pay with coworkers, and I want to emphasize that he was not terminated at all but rather resigned his position after finding another job. 

I was recently contacted by another employer seeking a reference on Adam. I was truthful, said the good, the bad, and also disclosed the behavior noted above. Several weeks later, Adam emailed me asking if someone from XYZ company had called for a reference on him, and If so, what I had said, since he thought the job interview went well yet he wasn't given an offer. I was honest with him, told him that I found out what he had been doing, thought it was noteworthy due to the problems it caused and therefore felt obliged to mention it. Whether the prospective employer felt that this type of behavior was acceptable was fully up to them. Adam then became angry and threatened a lawsuit against me for retaliating against him for doing something that was fully legal. I have not yet responded to the threat. I believe he was just venting and has no actual intention of filing a lawsuit. 

The way I see it is, at the end of the day all I did was relay the facts. Adam was the one to engage in the questionable behavior, and XYZ company was the one to turn him down for the job based on this behavior.

1,"AITA For ruining my nephew's birthday party after I was mocked and made fun of by my family? | When me (20M) and my brother Steve (28M) were growing up, there was a lot of competition between us and I always felt that my parents/other family paid more attention to him. For example, his HS graduation was a bigger deal with lots of people attending, mine was just a quiet dinner. That was just one thing among many others.

I know it's a bit petty, but I think I do hold some resentment. So Steve graduated from college years ago and it was a big deal since he was the first person to graduate in our family.  I am in college right now and have to take an extra year due to some other issues I am having and I've been frustrated about it.

So my brother has a 3 year old son, and was throwing a big birthday party for him. Throughout the party I was ridiculed, for example, in a conversation with my uncle and aunt, my aunt said about me ""well at least if this one doesn't graduate college, we'll still have Steve to celebrate about."" 

Steve also made a few digs at me, saying in a supposed joking manner ""once you drop out, I'll get you a job to shine my shoes every morning"" and people around me laughed, including my parents. I was ticked me off because I hate being reminded of my failures.

In addition, when there were a few guests that arrived, they ignored me straight up completely and went to Steve even if I was standing right there.

I got so fed up that I walked over to the birthday cake that was sitting on the table in the back and when no one was looking, I punched my fist through the middle of it, then I went back and joined the party.

It turned out to be a mistake since someone did see me and informed my parents. My parents called me outside and scolded me and told me I was being selfish, I told them I was tired of being mocked and how they were also just as bad for not doing anything about it.

I was told to go apologize to Steve and try to make it up to him, and when we went back inside he ran over to me and asked ""what is your fucking problem?""

I told him that I hate being made fun of, but Steve did not express remorse and instead told me to go apologize to his son for ruining the cake, I told him ""you apologize first you fucking dickhead."" His son was only 3 years old, so I figured he wouldn't even remember what happened, and I was mad that Steve refused to acknowledge his bullying.

Steve yelled at me and kicked me out and at this point everyone was looking, I told him to go fuck himself and left. He hasn't talked to me since and supposedly told my parents that he is going to keep his nephew away from me.

I've read a few posts that sounded like arguments I've had with my gf (29f and 34m) and I've sent them to her to see how they've been hashed out so she can see other perspectives.


Examples like someone who wanted to know if they were TA for asking his gf to point out what chores needed done, or someone who hopped the line at a cafe because the barista knew their order and could add it in real quick. There have been a few regarding owing money, drunk behavior and about doing certain things for family that we have had situations similar to, and so I've showed her the comments so she can see the outside neutral perspectives of a randomly selected jury, essentially.

1,"AITA for telling my cousin that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable? | Hey yo. So my cousin (19F) has been staying at our house for like a month now. In the house are me (17M), my brother (20M), my parents, and my grandma. I’ll admit right now that I’m a bit narcissistic. I think pretty much every girl is into me. I’m usually pretty accurate though, according to my friends. My narcissism isn’t unfounded though. I was the starting shooting guard on the varsity basketball team and I’m good-looking. My brother on the other hand is more average. 


One thing that has been irking me lately is my cousin’s flirtatious hair flipping, where she runs her hand through her long hair ad cranks her neck sideways and back or just shakes her head left to right to get her hair flowing. This seems like a new habit. She does this tens of times a day. I never really got the feeling that she was into me before, but it sure seems like it now. It might be because I’m more mature now. She seems to be very enthralled in whatever I have to say and she’s always hanging out with me whenever I’m outside my room. I don’t mind that. I just don’t like it when she makes her flirting so obvious, à la the flirtatious hair flipping. A few times a day when I’m in her presence, she would do the hair flipping. It makes me very uncomfortable. She would also do it sometimes when other family members are around, but I notice it more often when it’s just her and I. 


While just her and I were in the living room yesterday diddling on our phones, I noticed her flirtatiously hair flipping six times in an hour. It happened four times while we were talking and she was sure she had my attention. I told her after the sixth time that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. I explained to her that she’s doing what most girls do when they’re into a guy and it’s very uncomfortable for me so she should stop. She said I’m full of myself and to stop being so god damn gross. I asked her why she was flipping her hair then. She said girls do that more often than I think and not for the reason that I think. I asked her what the reason was then. She said it’s just to make sure her hair is in order. I said okay incredulously. We were sitting awkwardly in silence for the next hour. I didn’t notice her flipping her hair. 


She told my brother about this incident when he came over. My brother said he couldn’t believe that I actually thought our cousin was flipping her hair because of me. I asked him why he couldn’t believe that. He said it’s because she’s our fucking cousin who has a boyfriend and that I’m not as hot as I think I am. I didn’t want to get into a competition with him because I like to show respect to my elders, but I’m legit a 9 and he’s like a 7.

1,"AITA for getting an AT&T worker fired? | About a week or two ago I was able to trade my android phone in for an iphone. I thought why not, never had one before. I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. 

I got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. 

So a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end. We talked for a bit and I found out they ended up letting the other worker go. Turns out the issue with me was the last straw. I couldn't believe it.

Recently, the department manager announced we are going on a one day company trip, and asked employees to RSVP - without giving any details about the sort of activity plan, insisting it was a surprise. The location sounded like it would involve hiking, which I'm all for. I said I would go, because why not.

As the date of said even got closer, management began dropping hints about the plan for the day. The day before, it turned out, there will be no hiking - they're taking us to a meat restaurant.

I'm vegan. And the manager knows that, because the previous ""fun"" activity the department did was a barbecue, in which I sat in front of an empty plate and drank coffee I brought from my desk. A pretty questionable way of spending the afternoon.

I asked if there will be vegan options. The manager laughed, and said ""Well, the beer is vegan, I think!"".

Which I found extra annoying, because I also don't drink, and that's not a secret either...

I notified the HR that I won't be attending after all, and will come to work as usual.

1,"AITA for hiding my husband's shirts? | My 39 year old husband dresses like a child. For work, he wears a button up shirt, jeans or Dockers, multi-colored sneakers and a belt with a large buckle of an animal. On weekends, he wears a t-shirt with some sort of comic/cartoon logo/character, a comic book character logo hat, jeans, multi-colored sneakers, a belt with a large buckle of a comic book character and his comic book character logo baseball hat. The only people who ever compliment his clothes are teens.

&#x200B;

He claims that other people at his work dress the same way, and they do ... but they don't wear huge belt buckles with animals on them and their shoes are more muted - all black sneakers, for example.

&#x200B;

I've tried all the hints - buying him nice clothes, shoes ... they all get returned or stuffed in the closet. I confronted him and said I would find him much more attractive if he dressed more his age, he laughed me off and said that when we met, he dressed the same so why should he change now, his is who he is.

&#x200B;

But when we met, we were 28. And he did NOT wear these clothes as often as he does now because even then he knew that girls aren't exactly attracted to a guy wearing comic book character shirts. I think it's a combo of the popularity of the Marvel movies and now him having a wife that has basically given him license to feel like he can wear whatever the fuck he wants. It's really the combination of it all together - clown shoes, comic book shirt, comic book belt buckle and hat that are just so stupid looking, I can't stand it. HE'S GONNA BE 40 FFS.

&#x200B;

I've told him this and he just shrugs. 

&#x200B;

A month ago, we went to a party and all the guys were dressed so nicely and simply ... and then there's my husband in his Deadpool hat, shorts, clown shoes, Batman belt and Green Lantern hat. Even his mates were poking fun at his outfit. 

&#x200B;

So I took a bunch of his shirts, packed them away and hid them. He has SO many shirts (he's a shopper and sucks at doing the laundry, but that's a separate issue) that I knew he wouldn't notice for awhile. He started dressing nicer - he assumed his comic book shirts were dirty so he started wearing plain t-shirts and polos that he usually never touches. He looked so nice and handsome, like how he did when we started dating. I love it. Shower him with affection because he looks SO MUCH BETTER. Tell him how nice he looks.

&#x200B;

Well, a month later, he found the box of shirts. He's now pissed at me. I told him it was for his own good, but he's not having any of it. He left for work mad at me but I really don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I threw them away or donated them or something. Tonight will be interesting.

&#x200B;

Anyway ... am I the asshole?

We sometimes all hung out together but nothing unusual. 

Within the last year or so I’ve noticed a change in how A behaves when we’re with my SO. A tries really hard to come off as very intelligent and “cool” in front of my SO and often at my expense; If my SO and I disagree with each other on something, A will debate me every time to just be on my SO’s side even when they’re wrong. A will argue with me on anything (even topics in my own career field) just to make themselves seem smarter than me in front of my SO. A will contradict themselves or back track something they said just to be in agreement with my SO. A also very often goes out of the way to talk to my SO about things in front of me that A knows I can’t contribute to like their mutual friends or movies they’ve seen that I haven’t. (Background, A and my SO knew of each other as children but have years between them age wise so they’ve never been actual friends until me.)

I’m not comfortable with that at this point. I am not by any means jealous or concerned, I trust my SO completely.

Last year, I gifted my wife expensive tickets to a show I thought she might enjoy. She got upset that I spent hundreds of dollars on a concert for an artist that she never once expressed in. She claimed that I got the tickets because I wanted to see the concert. I honestly thought it would be a cool experience for the both of us to see this iconic band.

This year, I wanted to surprise my wife for V-day with something nice. I rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because I was taking her around from 1 place to another. (I will say that my wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, I did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and I went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that we could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

&#x200B;

not having coffee all day when i know that's the only thing she needs every day (she doesn't care about food as much as she cares about getting her one cup of coffee)

me spending $ on a fancy car (when she doesn't care for fancy cars and because we only rode in it fror about 20 minutes each way and the car was parked all day in the city)

me taking her to my favorite weed store as part of the surprise and having to wait 30 minutes for the guy to show up to the store (if i had told her what we were doing, she would have gotten coffee in that time but i kept it a surprise)

me giving her nice or fancy gifts when she doesn't want or care for them

me making her walk in the cold when she had thin dress pants on for the interview and not allowing her any time to change. . .

me getting upset when she doesn't show appreciation for my efforts

me not taking medication for my depression

me not going to sleep on time (reason for my tiredness)

I don't get it. I try and she's not happy. Every time I surprise her with nice things or notes, she questions it.  

Anyways, we got into an argument and she told me she's tired of me being depressed on every other day and then being all perky for an occasion. It seems fake to her.

0,"AITA for taking a break after something hurtful on my birthday? | This week has been the worst week of my life. Today was my 19th birthday. My mum was diagnosed with heart failure - I’m devastated, and it’s been particularly difficult because she’s been in hospital whilst my dad, who has dementia, needs someone at home at all times to make sure he’s fed, showered, clothed, well looked after, happy.

Naturally, I took time off of university to look after him and visit my mum in the hospital. I love them both and I would do so much for them. Since her discharge 2 days ago I have had to juggle my part time job, university, looking after my dad. Once again, this is absolutely fine with me and I’d do it all again in a heartbeat.

Today is my birthday and I caught a stomach bug. I had diarrhoea and was vomiting all night until there was nothing left, so I became really dehydrated and lost quite a bit of weight. I went to the doctor so I could be prescribed something for the dehydration and pretty much slept the rest of the day, taking minimal sips of her prescribed fluids since nothing was staying down.

My family has this tradition every year where we have a birthday dinner, so the birthday person will pick a place to eat and we’ll have a good time as a family. Today, my mum decided she wanted expensive gourmet burgers, but I said to her that I was really sick right now and would prefer if everyone ate something cheaper and healthier for tonight and if we could postpone the burgers for a later date when I felt better, partially because I also didn’t want the smell of burgers all around also.

My doctor had told me not to eat any greasy foods. I wasn’t able to keep anything down, so even though I love burgers I just knew that I would get sick if I ate them so they’d be a waste.

My mum went livid. She told me she wanted burgers, and I said that was fine, but I also knew we couldn’t afford a second birthday dinner since we don’t have much money and that I really wanted to spend family time together, with this being my only birthday wish. She called me a selfish, childish bitch and I was very hurt by this. I had spent the entire past week trying to help my parents and I thought my birthday would be the one day where I could be allowed to be a little selfish, so I decided I needed a time out. She went out to get burgers and the beautiful cake she ordered (which I am very thankful for, since she ordered it before I was sick and there’s nothing I can really do about that now).

I decided to go to my boyfriend’s house to study just to clear my head and get away for a little bit. I left my mum a note saying that I’ll be back before 11, that I just needed some space to cool off (because this had been a really hard week for all of us) and that I loved her very much.

A lot more has happened since - my Mum is really upset and telling me to leave her and my dad alone forever which really hurts me because I do love them so much and I’m trying my best - I just needed a break.

0,"AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter? | My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

0,"AITA for asking my Fiance to agree to a childfree wedding? | So here go!  Am I am the asshole for asking the soon to be hubs for a child free wedding?

My Finace of 2 1/2 years and I are set to be married in a little over a year.  We have been pretty much in agreement over most of the wedding planning except this one thing.

I told my Fiance that I would like to have a child free wedding because I do not want babies and little ones screaming, crying, or running around during our ceremony and reception.  This is our special day and I do not want that annoyance. Especially during vows!  

My Fiance however said that he wants his 11 year old son and his 4 year old niece to be apart of the day and be in the pictures and what not. I told him that i understand this, I really do. But I want this to be elegant. Not like a back yard barbeque.  I also told him that I want to be his focus on our big day and feel his son especially will want most of his focus as he always does when he is around. He says he will try and prioritize me but I know how it will go. My soon to be stepson will whine and literally cry until he gets the attention.
